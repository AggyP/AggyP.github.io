Hi I am Aggy, I am a Data Scientist. Graduated with a bachelor degree of applied mathematics (Operational research) and a master degree of Data Science & Analytics in Universiti Sains Malaysia. I got an offer for PhD in computational intelligence, but for some reasons I didn't continue. Anyhow I learnt a lot from my academic and industry supervisors. In my current work, I worked with agriculture related data to identify insights and develop model for prediction and forecasting. Sometimes I used Powerbi to create visualization and dashboard. 
 
I am fitness enthusiast, passionate on doing various kind of exercise to build my stamina, strength, and endurance. 


I do play some Instruments to improve my cognitive ability, The instruments I used to play are piano and flute and I have performed in the Chinese Orchestra concert for 3 years.

Have a nice day!
