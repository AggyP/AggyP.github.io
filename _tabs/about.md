Hi I am Aggy, I am a Data Scientist. Graduated with a bachelor degree of applied mathematics (Operational research) and a master degree of Data Science & Analytics in Universiti Sains Malaysia. In my current work, I worked with agriculture related data to identify insights and develop model for prediction and forecasting. Sometimes I used Powerbi to create visualization and dashboard.

Other than doing analysis, I spent my time improve my strength and endurances 

I do play some Instruments. Instruments I play I used to play is piano and flute and I have performed in the Chinese Orchestra concert for 3 years.
