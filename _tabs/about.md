![Picture](/assets/profilepic/me3.png){: width="972" height="400" .w-50 .left}Hi I am Aggy, I am a Data Scientist. Graduated with a bachelor degree of applied mathematics(Operational research) and a master degree of Data Science & Analytics in Universiti Sains Malaysia. I received an offer for a PhD in computational intelligence and worked as a teaching assistant, supporting my supervisor in classes and guiding his master's students. In my current work as a Data Scientist, I engage a lot with sensor data to uncover insights and construct models for prediction and forecasting. Additionally, I build end-to-end data pipelines in the cloud to process sensor data and store them in databases, visualizing it using Power BI and custom-built web applications. Occasionally, I also develop systems using the .NET Core MVC framework. I find great satisfaction in witnessing the outcomes of my efforts.
 
Other than doing analysis, I am fitness enthusiast, passionate on doing various kind of exercise to build my stamina, strength, and endurance. I love doing HIIT, circuit training, muay thai, and yoga.
